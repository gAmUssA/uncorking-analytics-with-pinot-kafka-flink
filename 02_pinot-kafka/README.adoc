=== Part 2: Real-time Ingestion with Kafka
* *Directory:* `02_pinot-kafka`
* *Objective:* Implement real-time data ingestion into Apache Pinot using Apache Kafka as the data source, simulating a stream of movie ratings.
* *Setup:*
** Make sure Docker Compose is running with the necessary services including Kafka and Apache Pinot.
** Navigate to the `02_pinot-kafka` directory where the necessary files and scripts are located.

* *Tasks:*

==== Step 1: Build and Launch with Docker
* *Description:* Prepare the environment by building and launching the required Docker containers, which include Apache Kafka (Kraft mode) and Apache Pinot components.
* *Action:*
+
[source,bash]
----
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
----

==== Step 2: *Optional* Create a Kafka Topic
* *Description:* Create a Kafka topic named `movie_ratings` for streaming movie rating data.
* *Action:*
+
[source,bash]
----
docker exec -it kafka kafka-topics.sh \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
    --create \
    --topic movie_ratings
----

==== Step 3: Configure Pinot Tables
* *Description:* Set up a REALTIME table in Apache Pinot to ingest data from the Kafka `movie_ratings` topic.
* *Action:*
+
[source,bash]
----
docker exec -it pinot-controller ./bin/pinot-admin.sh \
    AddTable \
    -tableConfigFile /tmp/pinot/table/ratings.table.json \
    -schemaFile /tmp/pinot/table/ratings.schema.json \
    -exec
----

* *Verification:*
** Check the real-time data streaming into Pinot by querying the `movie_ratings` table in the Pinot console:
+
[source,bash]
----
http://localhost:9000/#/query?query=select+*+from+movie_ratings+limit+10&tracing=false&useMSE=false
----

==== Step 4: Apache Pinot Advanced Usage (Optional)
* *Description:* Explore advanced features of Apache Pinot such as running multi-stage joins between real-time and batch data.
* *Action:*
** Enable 'Use Multi-Stage Engine' in the Pinot console to perform complex queries.

[source,sql]
----
select
    r.rating as latest_rating,
    m.rating as initial_rating,
    m.title,
    m.genres,
    m.releaseYear
from movies m
         left join movie_ratings r 
             on m.movieId = r.movieId
where r.rating > 0.9
order by r.rating desc
    limit 10
----

==== Clean Up
* To stop and remove all services related to this part of the workshop, run:
+
[source,bash]
----
make destroy
----

==== Troubleshooting
* If encountering issues such as 'No space left on device' during the Docker build process, free up space using:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker system prune -f
----
